 		<ul>In the current release, we :
 			<li>Introduced a groovy script for cleaning up reference keeper nodes used by import/export service, it will be executed during first Jahia startup after migration and depending on your environmenet will take some times.</li>
 			<li>Fixed issue where a tokenized form could not be submitted in contribute mode right after content creation/deletion.For compatibility of form submission with contribute mode, if you are using a relative form action in your module that looks like: <form action="${renderContext.mainResource.node.name}/*" class="pageFormCreation" method="post" name="${formid}"> You should modify it to: <form class="pageFormCreation" method="post" action="" name="${formid}";> Otherwise the URL will not work with contribute mode.</li>
 			<li>Added ability to return more than one spellcheck suggestion that introduced several modifications in SearchProvider interface, SearchService interface and Suggestion class. In case you have your own implementation of these provider or service, you need to take into account these last modifications.</li>
