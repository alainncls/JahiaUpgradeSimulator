If the merge fails you will be able to overwrite the files or skip it installing the modification.</p> <p>If the merge fails or you decide to skip it, a diff file &lt;FILE_NAME&gt;.patch will be available in the destination folder, please make sure that you don&#39;t forget to manually apply the changes.</p> <h4>1. Stop Jahia</h4> <h4>2a. If you are upgrading your complete Digital Factory package :</h4> <h4>Open a terminal in the JAHIA_INSTALLATION/ and type the following command:</h4> <pre>java -jar &lt;PATH-TO-FIX-APPLIER&gt;/&lt;FIXAPPLIER_PACKAGE_NAME&gt;.jar</pre> <p>If you are using Digital Factory in a web context other than ROOT:</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>If you have installed Digital Factory in another context than the default ROOT context, you will need to specify the directory location of the Digital Factory web application on the file system in a command line option, as in the following example:</p> <pre>java -DwebappDirectory=tomcat/webapps/jahia -jar -jar Enterprise-DigitalFactory7.0-package_7.0.0.3_r51686_to_7.0.0.4_r51888.jar</pre> <p>In the above example the &quot;jahia&quot; context has been used instead of the default ROOT context. Note that the web application could be located anywhere else, simply specify the directory in the command line property and the FixApplier will look for it in the specified directory.</p> <h4>2b. If you are upgrading your webapps :</h4> <h4>Open a terminal in the JAHIA_INSTALLATION/tomcat/webapps/ROOT or JAHIA_INSTALLATION/tomcat/webapps/&lt;your context&gt; if you didn&#39;t use the default ROOT context&nbsp; and type the following command:</h4> <pre>java -jar &lt;PATH-TO-FIX-APPLIER&gt;/&lt;FIXAPPLIER_NAME&gt;.jar</pre> <p>Then unzip <a href=/downloads/jahia/digitalfactory7.0.0/licenses-3rd-party.zip>this zip file </a> containing 3-rd party licenses&nbsp; into &lt;digital-factory-home&gt;/licenses/3rd-party folder.</p> <p>The fix applier will manage the upgrade of your platform by deleting, updating and merging all the necessary files. It will now handles the migration of Jahia Core and all the additional Jahia modules installed on your platform.</p> <p>In case you have externalized your configuration (jar file or folder), you will need to apply the modification relative to jahia.properties&nbsp; jahia.node.properties manually at the appropriate place.</p> <p>Please review your log before starting the next step to ensure you haven&#39;t missed a file that needs to be manually merged.</p> <h4>3. Clean the following Tomcat folder</h4> <p>The fix applier now handles the cleaning of the tomcat folders automatically but depending on the OS and some permissions you may need to clean it manually.</p> <div class=warning-message>Remove the content of your folders &lt;JAHIA_INSTALLATION&gt;/tomcat/temp and &lt;JAHIA_INSTALLATION&gt;/tomcat/work</div> <h4>4. Clean the ressource folder</h4> <p>The fix applier will also handles the cleaning of the &lt;JAHIA_INSTALLATION&gt;/digital-factory-data/generated-resources folder automatically but depending on the OS and some permissions you may need to clean it manually.</p> <h4><span style=\"font-size: 17.5px;\">6. Start your JAHIA</span></h4> <div class=help-message>Your Digital Factory upgrade is now completed.</div>",
