		<p>In the current release we have fixed a security issue on tokenized form for allowing a token to be submitted only once so tokens are not reusable anymore. In order to be able to reuse token as it was before the release, we provided a property to set in the tokenizedForm tag: <template:tokenizedform allowsmultiplesubmits="true">. If you have already used this tag in your modules please review your implementation.</p>
