 		<p>Since version 6.6.2.5 we modified the way we were saving file links in richtexts by using the placeholder {workspace} in the url which is then dynamically interpreted in default and live workspaces instead of previous hard-coded values /live and /default. In the current release we introduced a migration groovy script which is executed at first startup after migration and corrects all existing links still containing these hard-coded values by replacing them with the new placeholder {workspace}. Depending on the volume of your data and the number of richtexts containing links, duration of this script's execution may vary.</p>
